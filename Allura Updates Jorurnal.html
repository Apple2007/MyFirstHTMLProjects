It all started when I watched the last episode of Voltron: Legandary Defender. I saw with my own eyes that Lance got Alltan marks
by Allura kissing Lance. I really wanted to know why this happend. So, I went on the internet to find out. All I found were people
talking about it and making guesses about why he got the marks. After a lot of work, I got nowhere. So, I stopped doing it and stopped
looking. This was the story of Allura Updates.
